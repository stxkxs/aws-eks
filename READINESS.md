- Documented upgrade and incident response procedures
- Backup capabilities

#### Level 2 Requirements (Standard Production)
- All Level 1 requirements
- All HIGH and MEDIUM priority items in all categories
- Automated security controls and policy enforcement
- Comprehensive monitoring with SLOs
- Regular DR testing
- Full CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure

#### Level 3 Requirements (Enterprise Production)
- All Level 1 and 2 requirements
- All items across all categories, regardless of priority
- Advanced features like chaos engineering
- Comprehensive compliance documentation
- Advanced cost optimization
- Automated remediation for common issues

## Current Readiness Assessment

Based on the checkboxes above:

- [⬜] Level 1 Readiness:
    - Missing: Backup & Restore, Pod Security, Network Policies, Cluster Upgrades, Node Rotation, Incident Response, Change Management, Security Scanning

- [⬜] Level 2 Readiness:
    - Missing all Level 1 gaps plus: Policy Enforcement, SLO Tracking, Secret Rotation, DR Testing, Capacity Planning, Infrastructure Testing, Drift Detection, Compliance Checks

- [⬜] Level 3 Readiness:
    - Missing all Level 2 gaps plus: Service Mesh, External DNS, Cost Estimation

## Action Plan Summary

1. **Focus on Level 1 gaps first:**
    - Implement backup solution
    - Add pod security standards
    - Implement network policies
    - Document and test cluster upgrade procedures
    - Create incident response and change management workflows

2. **Then address Level 2 items:**
    - Implement policy enforcement
    - Set up SLO tracking and monitoring
    - Create secret rotation mechanisms
    - Develop and test DR procedures
    - Add infrastructure testing and compliance checks

3. **Finally complete Level 3 requirements:**
    - Evaluate service mesh needs
    - Implement external DNS integration
    - Add cost management tools
    - Implement advanced features

## Certification Process
